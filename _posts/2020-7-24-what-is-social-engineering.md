You may have heard that humans are the weakest link in security and this is often true. This is why social engineering attacks are so successful. So just what is social engineering?

Put simply, social engineering exploits the vulnerabilities in humans. For an attacker, it may be much easier to trick you into giving up your password than actually trying to
"hack" it. Or on a larger scale, the easiest way into a company building may be dressing up as a delivery or maintenance person and just walking through the front door. There
are many avenues of social engineering attacks so only the three most prevalent (in my humble opinion) are listed below.

### Phishing & Baiting

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that focuses on getting users to take a certain action to hand over login credentials. A phishing attack could be an email that
looks very much like an official email you'd get from your bank, asking you to click a link to reset your password for example. However, if the mail was sent by an attacker,
that link you just clicked likely brought you to a page that looks very similar (and possibly  almost entirely identical to the real bank's website) but is actually a fake
one designed to capture your login details.

Baiting is exactly what it sounds like. You're the fish and the attacker is dangling bait above you. This bait could be a USB device you happened to find in the parking lot
of your office building. Being human, naturally you want to see what's on the device, so you plug it into your machine. Unknown to you, this was an attacker's device and
you just did exactly what he wanted you to and have likely given the attacker access to your machine. Another type of bait could be a link that promises some new movie or free
item that you're interested in, but really just leads you to some type of malware.

### Impersonation

Fairly self explanatory yet again, impersonation is the act of pretending to be another entity to gain access or information. One could impersonate a delivery driver or
maintenance person to gain easy access to a building. One could call up an ISP or mobile provider and pretend to be the person they're trying to gain information on and ask
the provider for details concerning that person's account.

### Summary

As mentioned earlier, there are in truth hundreds of different social engineering attacks and dozens of names for each one. To list them all here would be almost impossible. If
you're interested in learning more of the attack types, a simple Google search of "social engineering" would help you greatly. But again, the three listed above are some
of the most prevalent and it was important to cover them if only briefly.

The most important thing to remember is to be aware of social engineering. Never be too trusting. Always verify who you're speaking to if possible. Social engineering
relies on human trust and exploitability, so when you employ a healthy air of skepticism, your chances of being socially engineered drop greatly.
