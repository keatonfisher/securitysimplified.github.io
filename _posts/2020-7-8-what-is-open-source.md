title: What Is Open Source?
categories: basics

When you use popular software, chances are its source code is not publicly accessible. This means you can't look through the code to make sure the software is doing what it 
says it's doing (and not something nefarious like collecting extra data about you), you often can't modify the software, and you are limited in your uses of the software.

Cue open source.

When software is open source, its source code is publicly accessible. Anyone can look through the code to verify that the program is doing what it's supposed to, you can 
modify the code to your heart's content, and you are typically unlimited in your uses of it. Open source software is usually a community project; developers and users can
work together to create or improve their software. Open source is quite simply open collaboration.

But does this mean anyone can change the code on any project for malicious purposes? No, updates or modifications to the source code have to be approved by its authors, whether
those authors are a community of people or a company in charge of the project. And if something fishy did somehow manage to slip in, it would be quickly caught since the code
is publicly accessible.

For digital privacy enthusiasts, open source software is particularly appealing. Users can see exactly what data an open source program is collecting and what it does with
that data. 

### Examples of Open Source Software and Closed Source Software:
