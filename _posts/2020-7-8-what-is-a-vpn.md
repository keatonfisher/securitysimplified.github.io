A VPN (Virtual Private Network) connects your device to a server located somewhere else and acts as a middleman between you and your destination. A VPN
essentially creates a tunnel to send your traffic through. A little lost? Don't worry.

Picture this: A helicopter is following a red car but there's a long tunnel coming up. The helicopter watches the car enter the tunnel but otherwise cannot see
anything happening inside. That red car could stop inside the tunnel, do some burnouts, have a party, and the only thing the helicopter would see is the car entering
and exiting the tunnel.

This is a bit like a VPN. When you connect to a VPN, anyone who happens to be snooping around your network traffic probably can't see what you're
doing anymore. They can only see that you connected and/or disconnected. This makes VPNs very useful in countries where you could be punished for what you look at online. 

Connecting to a VPN will also change your IP address. Your IP address can be used to geolocate you. This is why lots of people use VPNs to circumnavigate 
regional restrictions on content. If a popular Netflix series isn't available in a certain country, one could connect to a VPN that's located in a different country,
which would change their IP address and trick Netflix into thinking they're in that other country. VPNs are widely used in countries like China, where
the government has installed a "Great Firewall of China" that censors a lot of information. Chinese residents can get around this censorship with VPNs. 

VPNs used to be a necessity for doing banking over public networks (like in hotels). There was a time when banking sites, important login forms, etc, didn't
use adequate security and anyone watching the network traffic could steal login information. For the most part this has mostly changed, as such sites are now
required to implement strong encryption methods on this information. 

It is important to note however that using a VPN for privacy/anonymity reasons comes with a certain level of trust. If your goal is to hide your
browing habits from everyone, be aware that using a VPN means you're hiding those habits from your ISP and handing them instead to the VPN provider. In
most cases all you have is the word of the VPN provider that they will not keep logs and picking a VPN provider ends up coming down to a game of
"who do I trust more with my data?"

#### In Summary

What a VPN can do:
- Bypass geographical restrictions
- Hide your real IP address
- Hide your browsing habits from your ISP/government (not always true however)
- Because you're connecting to a server, you can use a VPN to connect to your home or business network and work remotely

With all the VPN advertisements out there, I recommend watching this [VPN commercial parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY)
from Tom Scott. The video provides an excellent breakdown of what a VPN can and can't do and some of the sneaky tactics VPN providers use to scare
you into believing you need to sign up with them immediately.
